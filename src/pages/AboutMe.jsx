                <p> My love for coding came about in my early teens when I took a basic Web Design/Java Programming class in High School. From then on, I spent many hours playing around with my blog's theme code, and that was when I realized I had found my calling. It has been a long time coming now but I'm happy to be having this opportunity to learn and grow my knowledge so that I can take the next step to work in the field I enjoy so much.
